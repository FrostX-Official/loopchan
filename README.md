### My first ever actual rust program (and yes, it's a discord bot for my game community.)
People are saying that it's hard to write bad code in Rust, this project proves 'em wrong. ðŸ˜¼

## TODOs ->
- Add cooldown to every command in main.rs -> handle_slash_command

- Giveaways
- Reaction Roles

## Unsure ->
- Moderation
- Logs

Moving all moderation and logs handling to loopchan can make it a bit heavy for current machine im using to host loopchan on, so not in main priority (probably never will be added)
